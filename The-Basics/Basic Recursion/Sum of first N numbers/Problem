You are given an integer ‘n’. Your task is determining the sum of the first ‘n’ natural numbers and returning it.

Example:
Input: ‘n’ = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: The sum of the first 3 natural numbers is 1 + 2 + 3, equal to 6.

Sample Input 1:
3
Sample Output 1 :
6
Explanation: The sum of the first 3 natural numbers is 1 + 2 + 3, equal to 6.

Sample Input 2:
5
Sample Output 2:
15
Explanation: The sum of the first 5 natural numbers is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5, equal to 15.
