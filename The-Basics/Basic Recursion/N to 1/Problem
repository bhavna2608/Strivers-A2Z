You are given an integer ‘n’. Your task is to return an array containing integers from ‘n’ to ‘1’ (in decreasing order) without using loops.

Example:
Input: ‘n’ = 5
Output: 5 4 3 2 1
Explanation: An array containing integers from ‘n’ to ‘1’ is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

Sample Input 1:
5
Sample Output 1 :
5 4 3 2 1
Explanation Of Sample Input 1: An array containing integers from ‘5’ to ‘1’ is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

Sample Input 2:
2
Sample Output 2:
2 1
Explanation Of Sample Input 2: Explanation: An array containing integers from ‘2’ to ‘1’ is [2, 1].

Expected Time Complexity:
The expected time complexity is O(n), where 'n' is the given integer.

Expected Space Complexity:
The expected space complexity is O(n), where 'n' is the given integer.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^4

Time Limit: 1-sec
