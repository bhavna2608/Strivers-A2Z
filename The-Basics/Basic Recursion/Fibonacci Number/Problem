Given an integer ‘n’, return first n Fibonacci numbers using a generator function.

Example:
Input: ‘n’ = 5
Output: 0 1 1 2 3
Explanation: First 5 Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, and 3.

Note:
You don't need to print anything. Just implement the given function.

Sample Input 1:
5
Sample Output 1:
0 1 1 2 3
Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
The first 5 Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 3.

Sample Input 2:
3
Sample Output 2:
0 1 1
Explanation Of Sample Input 2:
The first 5 Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1.

Expected time complexity
The expected time complexity is O(n).

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 45
Time Limit: 1 s
