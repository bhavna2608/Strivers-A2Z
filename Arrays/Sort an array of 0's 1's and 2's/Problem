You have been given an array/list 'arr' consisting of 'n' elements. Each element in the array is either 0, 1 or 2.
Sort this array/list in increasing order. Do not make a new array/list. Make changes in the given array/list.

Sample Input 1:
8
2 2 2 2 0 0 1 0
Sample Output 1:
0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2
Explanation of sample input 1 :
The initial array 'arr' is [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0].

After sorting the array in increasing order, 'arr' is equal to:
[0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]

Sample Input 2:
5
1 1 1 1 1
Sample Output 2:
1 1 1 1 1

Expected time complexity :
The expected time complexity is O(n).

Constraints:
1 <= 'n' <= 10 ^ 4
0 <= 'arr[i]' <= 2

Time limit: 1 second
