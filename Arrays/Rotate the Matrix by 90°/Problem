You are given a square matrix ‘Mat’ of size ‘N’. You need to rotate ‘Mat’ by 90 degrees in the clockwise direction.

Note: You must rotate the matrix in place, i.e., you must modify the given matrix itself. You must not allocate another square matrix for rotation.

For example:
‘N’ = 2 and ‘Mat’ = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}, we must modify ‘Mat’ to {{3, 1}, {4, 2}}.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Mat[i][j] <= 10^9

Time Limit: 1 sec
