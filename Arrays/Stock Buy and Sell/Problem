You are given an array of integers 'prices' of size 'n', where ‘prices[i]’ is the price of a given stock on an ‘i’-th day.
You want to maximize the profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and a different day to sell that stock.
Please note that you can’t sell a stock before you buy one. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.

Sample Input 1:
6
7 1 5 4 3 6
Sample Output 1 :
5
Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
Purchase stock on day two, where the price is one, and sell it on day six, where the price is 6. Profit = 6 - 1 = 5.

Sample Input 2:
5
5 4 3 2 1
Sample Output 2 :
0

Expected time complexity :
The expected time complexity is O(n).

Constraints :
1 <= 'n' <= 10 ^ 5
1 <= ‘prices[i]’<= 10 ^ 9

Time Limit: 1 sec
