You have been given two strings, 'str1' and 'str2'.
Your task is to return true if the given two strings are isomorphic to each other, else return false.

Note :
Two strings are isomorphic if a one-to-one mapping is possible for every character of the first string ‘str1’ to every character 
of the second string ‘str2’ while preserving the order of the characters.
All occurrences of every character in the first string ‘str1’ should map to the same character in the second string, ‘str2’.

For example :

Sample Input 1 :
aab 
xxy
Sample Output 1 :
1
Explanation of sample input 1:
The character ‘a’ maps to ‘x’ and ‘b’ maps to ‘y’. Hence, the answer is 1 in this case.

Sample Input 2 :
aab
xyz
Sample Output 2 :
0

Constraints :
1 <= |str1|, |str2| <= 10^3
|str1| is the length of the string str1, and |str2| is the length of the string str2.
