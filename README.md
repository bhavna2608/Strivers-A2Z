# Strivers-A2Z

I have just begun my DSA journey. Since I am proficient in Data Science/Machine Learning, my preferred language of coding is Python and so in this repository where I plan on posting my solutions/tips or other useful information required to solve **Strivers A2Z DSA Course** for beginners, I will use **Python** as the programming language. I will try to update this repository on a daily basis as I go along my journey and hopefully, by the end of it, I would be able to call myself a decent Python programmer! 

Excited for the journey ahead! I hope it helps you as well! :)
